\section{Introduction}

This project requires the development of a logic simulation program,
implemented in C++. When completed, the application will read a
definition file containing a list of devices and the connections
between them. It will then graphically display the values of specified
monitor points in the circuit as the simulation is run. Some legacy
code has been provided, but lacks a scanner, parser and GUI which will
be developed in this project.

\subsection{Teamwork Planning}

The GUI development requires learning and reference to the wxWidgets
and OpenGL packages, so makes sense for one team member to focus
efforts here. The scanner and parser will require robust coding and
testing, so it was decided to combine the two as a peer programming
project to allow implementation and testing to be carried out by
different team members.

The work is to be distributed as follows: Andrew will code the GUI,
and James and George will write and test the scanner and parser.

\section{Syntax Specification}

The syntax for the circuit definition files was defined and described
using the following EBNF code:
